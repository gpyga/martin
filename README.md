Macros Allowing for Regression Trees in Netezza

This was a set of SAS macros I set up a few years back to allow for the training and scoring of tree-based ML algorithms in Netezza with SAS as a wrapper. The motivation was to overcome some contraints imposed by a previous employer which made it needlessly difficult to implement any form of machine learning in marketing models. 

This is not an active project, and will not be maintained. Thanks to modernization efforts by the previous employer, these macros are no longer being used (I believe since 2020).

This repository exists purely as a project in my portfolio.
